This repository contains the code described in the [Mission: Iconic Reef (MIR) Large Area Imaging (LAI) Guide]() and can be used to create large 3D reconstructed underwater scenes. The purpose of these scripts is to streamline and standardize, as much as possible, the processing of hundreds of LAI datasets

## Workflow 

The workflow consists of `5` parts, and can be run from within Metashape using the `Script` tool. The scripted steps (see below) can be used to reconstuct an individual scene, or multiple scenes in succession; this is done by repeatedly running the respective script in a **loop**, one after the other.  

**The steps include:**  
1. Within Metashape `Scripts`, or via commandline, run script `MIR_Metashape_Processing_I.py`
   - This will run all necessary steps from importing cameras, alignment, detecting markers, to alignment
   - Note that this script can process multiple scenes
2. Within Metashape, manually define ground control points (i.e., markers), if applicable
3. Within Metashape `Scripts`, or via commandline, run script `MIR_Metashape_Processing_II.py`
    - This will run all necessary steps from optimizing camera alignment, filtering points based on uncertainty, to creating a dense point cloud
   - Note that this script can process multiple scenes
5. Within Metashape, manually inspect Dense Cloud and define the scene's bounding polygon to reduce excess space
6. Within Metashape `Scripts`, or via commandline, run script `MIR_Metashape_Processing_III.py`
    - This will run all necessary steps for creating a DEM, mesh, and orthomosaic, and exporting the data products to disk
   - Note that this script can process multiple scenes
  
For more details on each script, please the [instructions](./Scripts/README.md) in the `Scripts` folder.

### Metashape Version

The scripts in this workflow use Metashape 1.8.4; because of updates, using other versions might cause the scripts to fail.
